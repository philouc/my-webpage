I am Doctoral student at CEA Paris-Saclay, working in the INRIA-CEA Parietal Team, with Dr Philippe Ciuciu, at NeuroSpin. I work on Compressed Sensing and its application to Imaging applications, particularly MRI. We strive towards obtaining higher resolution MR scans from a scan of significantly reduced scan time. My thesis is on Joint optimization of sampling and image reconstruction in MRI. My interests include signal processing, mathematical modeling and computer architecture. Overall I have love to learn new things and stay curious.
