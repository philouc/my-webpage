Dr. Ciuciu is a CEA Research Director at [NeuroSpin](https://joliot.cea.fr/drf/joliot/en/Pages/research_entities/NeuroSpin.aspx) ([CEA](https://www.cea.fr/english)), the largest ultra-high field MRI center in France dedicated to cognitive and clinical neuroscience research. He has a joint appointment with [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en), the French institute of computer Science and automatic control where he has led, since 2018, the Compressed Sensing team in the Inria-CEA [Parietal](https://team.inria.fr/parietal/) unit located at NeuroSpin. Since Apr. 2022, due to his expertise in neuroimaging techniques, brain data analysis, and machine learning, he has been leading the new joint Inria-CEA unit [MIND, (Models and Inference for Neuroimaging Data)](https://team.inria.fr/mind/), a cutting edge research unit comprised of 40 researchers and staff.
His inter-disciplinary research interests range from methodological developments in accelerated MRI to cutting-edge signal processing tools for the analysis of functional brain data (fMRI, M/EEG) with applications in cognitive and clinical neuroscience (neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration).
