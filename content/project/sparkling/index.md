Very high-resolution MRI will provide particularly detailed images of the brain. However, the acquisition times of MRI data strongly increase with resolution. To solve this problem, our team has developed an algorithm called SPARKLING, which stands for Spreading Projection Algorithm for Rapid K-space sampLING that allows us to reduce scan times by a factor of 20 without degrading image quality.
